5.1

- Redefine "Unique Transaction IDs" in v1.0 as the HTTP "X-Request-ID" Header i.e. https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/http-request-id
   - Does anyone have a better reference for https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/http-request-id ?
- Should this be further defined as https://www.wireshark.org/docs/wsug_html_chunked/ChAdvFollowTCPSection.html rather than a web application or load balancer HTTP "X-Request-ID" Header?

5.2

- Redefine "Access Logs" as 1. "web application transaction" [log] and 2. "WAF Configuration Changes" [log]

5.3

- I would consider "Event logs and notification" out of scope as this would be addressed by other standards bodies e.g. SCAP
- If included in scope of v2 then add Wireshark/PCAP and Burp Proxy State.

5.4 

- An end user would be interested to know how much web application traffic could be inserted into the web application transaction log "after the fact" when a suspicious transaction is detected?
- An end user would like to export a Wireshark/PCAP and Burp Proxy State and could as raised in 5.3 above.

5.5 

- I would consider "Log access" to be out of scope as it would be addressed by other standards bodies e.g. PCI Security Standard Council, ASD, ISO, etc

5.6

- I would consider "Syslog support" to be out of scope as this would be addressed by other standards bodies e.g. PCI Security Standard Council, ASD, ISO, etc
- If included in scope of v2 then add "Windows Event Log Subscriptions"

5.7  

- I would consider "5.7 Log retention" to be out of scope as this would be addressed by other standards bodies e.g. PCI Security Standard Council, ASD, ISO, etc
- If included in scope then refer to 5.4 i.e. "inserted into the web application transaction log "after the fact" when a suspicious transaction is detected"

5.8

- I would consider "Handling of sensitive data" to be out of scope as this would be addressed by other standards bodies e.g. PCI Security Standard Council, ASD, ISO, etc
