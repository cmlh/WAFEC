In relation to WAFEC v1.0 Section 4 - "Protection Techniques" i.e.
https://files.pbworks.com/download/jMK6E7P3YC/webappsec/13247060/wasc-wafec-v1.0.html?ld=1#N103B9

As per the quote within the introduction paragraph, should this be
aligned with http://projects.webappsec.org/w/page/13246978/Threat-Classification
as a view i.e. http://projects.webappsec.org/w/page/13246977/Threat-Classification-Views
?

Another consideration is since that Robert has announced that
http://projects.webappsec.org/w/page/13246978/Threat-Classification
has commenced their next revision what effect will this have on the
above alignment?
